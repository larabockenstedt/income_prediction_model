# income_prediction_model
In this project for OpenClassrooms, a bank is looking to target new potential customers who are more likely to have higher incomes later in life. The goal of the project is to create a model to predict a person's future income.

## About the Project
The first part of the project included descriptive statistics in a short univariate analysis of each variable and short bivariate analyses of several of the variables. It was followed by a k-means classification and a first factorial plane visualization. Afterward, a logistic regression was conducted and a program prepared to model the data. 

In the dataset provided by OpenClassrooms, the geometric characteristics of banknotes were specificed. The columns included: 
* The length of the note (in mm).
* The height of the note (measured on the left side, in mm).
* The height of the note (measured on the right side, in mm).
* The margin between the top edge of the note and the main image (in mm).
* The margin between the bottom edge of the note and the main image (in mm).
* The diagonal measurement of the note (in mm).

The functions.py file was used to help with the kmeans clustering, and was created by OpenClassrooms for a course.

## Built With
This project was built using Jupyter Notebook.
